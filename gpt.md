Create an outline for a presentation of a interface named psrhub. Here are some key points that I want to talk out during the keynote:

- Generic views generation
- Easy to integrate with the models
- Made using flutter
- Cross-plataform (windows, mac, and linux)
- Database made using SQLite
- Color scheme seeding
- MVVM architecture, easy to develop, and decentralized (we already have 3 developers working on)
- There are currently 3 models already integrated: GNoMo, HyCo, OptBio

Add to the keynote some space for hands-on and walkthrough
